Java Tips 

Importing :

java.lang always internally import we don't need to import it explicitly.

import static java.lang.System.out;

by using this we don't need to use system.out instead we can use out.println();

import static java.util.Collections.*; 
we can import all static methods from Collections.
so w ecan use sort() instead of Collections.sort().

Access Modifier :

public , protected , default , private.

class can be either public or default (no modifier)
private-only accesseble only inside that specific class.
public - can accessable every where.
protected-same package and it's subclasses.

final :
if a class is final it can't extended you can't do inheritance .

To prevent modifying behviour of a specific class.

Methods can also be final if a method is final it can't be overriden.

if a variable is final it can't be changed furthur only be assigned once.

static : it can be shared among all the objects. non static methods or variables  can't be accessed from static methods.

A non-static inner class instance can't be created without an instance of outer class.
 A static method doesn't require outer class instance to create inner class object.

enums :
ordinal() -> to get index.
enum Season{
private int idx;

SUMMER(1),WINTER(2),SPRING(3);
private public  Season(int n)
{
this.idx=n;
}
public int getValue()
{
return value;
}
}
public class enums{
public static vod main()
{
Season season=Season.valueOf("WINTER);
System.out.println(Season.WINTER.getvalue());
Sout(Arrays.toString(Season.values()); 
// Season.values will return array.
}
}
