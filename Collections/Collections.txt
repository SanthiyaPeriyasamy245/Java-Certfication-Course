
   Collections : List , Set , Queue, Map .
 
   List.of() - it's a static method which is used to create immutable list.
   List : it helps to store and remove an element at specific index and it allows duplicates.

  List<String>arr=List.of("Brindha","Priya","Yamuna"); -> immutable list
  List<String>newarr=new ArrayList<String>(arr);

  ArrayList : insertion & deletion is slow.
  LinkedList :  insertion & deletion fast but iteration is slow.	

  Vector is synchronized -thread safe and almost constant time access
  ArrayList isn't synchronized - it's not thread safe 

  To compare two objects of same type we need to implement comparable interface which has compareto() method.

   Comparable interface provides natural ordering (for sorting).
   Comparator interface is to provide sorting based on the user preference.

   Enhance for loop will thrown concurrent modification exception when we try to modify the list. because modifcation during traversal is    not   coordinated so it will throw that exception.

   To modify the list while traversing we can use iterator.
