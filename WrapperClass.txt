
Wrapper Classes

-> All wrapper classes are immutable.

-> there are the ways to assign a value using wrapper class.
	Integer value=new Integer(3); 
	Integer num=new Integer(3)

-> value==num will result in flase;

	Integer value1=Integer.ValueOf(2);
	Integer num1=Integer.ValueOf(2);

->here valuOf wil lcheck for if thee is anyother object exist with same value then it will use that one.to reference variable will refer to same object.

->by using Integer.valueOf() method we can reuse the object if it's already been created.
value1==num1 will result in true.

Integer.valueOf() helps in create an instance.
for eg; Integer v=Integer.valueOf(5);
     it will be like v=5; this is known as auto boxing.

Integer.MAX_VALUE -> provides maximum value of type int.
Integer.MIN_VALUE -> provides minimum value of type int
Integer.SIZE -> provides bit size of int which is 32
Integer.BYTES -> provies byte value of int type which is 4.
