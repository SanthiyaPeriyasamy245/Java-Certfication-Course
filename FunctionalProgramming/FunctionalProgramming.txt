Functional Programming


Functions are first class citizens.

functions can be treated like any other variable or object

They can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and assigned to variables.

 Streams are often used for operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing data.

Unlike collections, streams do not store data; instead, they operate on a source (like a collection or array) and produce a result without modifying the original source.

Lambda expression - short hand method.
