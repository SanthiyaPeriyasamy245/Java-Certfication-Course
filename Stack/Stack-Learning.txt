 -First in first out
- Last in last out
- Internally it uses array to store an element
- It uses pointer variable whenever element get pop() or push().
-actually element is not getting deleted pointer which moves whenever pop() method get called.

for an example . in a stakcif i have elements like,

ptr=4; -> whenever pop gets exectuted it reduce by 1 
[1,2,3,4,5] when i call pop() method it will display 5
then again pop() 4 and so on...
