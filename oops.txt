Object Oriented Programming

1. class -> template to create an object it consist of variables and functions.
2. Object -> Physical Reality
3. Reference variables stored at stack memory and objects are stored in heap memory.
4. "dot" operator used to connect the reference variable with the object's instance variables.
5. "New" is a keyword to allocate a memory space in the heap for an object.
6. constructor will be called whenever we creating an object using new key word.
7. object creation done at run time and reference variable memory allocation done at compile time.
8. Constructor over loading can be done.
9. this. refers to the current object.
10. this() refers to the current constructor.
11. Wrapper class final class which is used to use primitives as objects.
12. final key word is used to make something as constant.
13. Garbage collection in java can't be done manually because it automatically does and we can able to know whenever the garbage collection happens by using finalize() method.
